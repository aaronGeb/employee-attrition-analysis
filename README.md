# Employee Attrition Rate Prediction
This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical HR data, we can identify key factors that contribute to employees leaving an organization and develop strategies to improve retention.

## Features
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying key patterns and trends in employee attrition.
- Machine Learning Models: Training and evaluating different models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
- Model Deployment: Deploying the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time predictions.
## Dataset

The dataset includes employee-related attributes such as:
- Age, Gender, Department
- Salary, Job Role, Work Experience
- Job Satisfaction, Performance Rating
- Attrition Status (Target Variable)
